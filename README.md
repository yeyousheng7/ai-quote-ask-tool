# AI Quote Annotation

Chrome/Edge Manifest V3 browser extension for quote-based follow-up questions on AI chat pages.

The extension lets you select a small piece of an assistant reply, create a local `提问` thread for that quote, and continue asking short follow-up questions in a floating panel without polluting the main conversation view.

## Supported Pages

- ChatGPT normal conversations: `https://chatgpt.com/c/*`
- ChatGPT GPT/project-style conversations: `https://chatgpt.com/g/*`
- Legacy ChatGPT host equivalents under `https://chat.openai.com/c/*` and `https://chat.openai.com/g/*`
- Gemini conversations: `https://gemini.google.com/app/*`

ChatGPT content scripts are allowed to load on the wider ChatGPT host so SPA navigation from the homepage into a supported route can be detected. The runtime only activates the plugin on supported conversation routes. Gemini is currently injected only under `/app/*`.

## Install For Development

1. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
2. Enable developer mode.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.
4. Select this project directory.
5. Open a supported ChatGPT or Gemini conversation page.

Clicking the extension icon opens a small popup:

- `ChatGPT 提问助手`
- `打开提问管理`

The popup opens the standalone local management page. It does not toggle the in-page panel.

## Core Features

- Select text inside a supported assistant reply and click `提问`.
- On ChatGPT, the plugin attaches its `提问` action next to ChatGPT's native selection toolbar when possible.
- On providers without a compatible native selection toolbar, the plugin shows a floating selection action near the selection.
- The selected text is highlighted and receives a `提问 N` chip when the DOM can safely support an inline chip.
- ChatGPT code blocks and tables use a block reference bar before the block, such as `引用自下方代码块` or `引用自下方表格`, so copying block content is not affected.
- Block reference bars show up to two `提问` chips and fold additional chips into `更多 N`.
- Formula surfaces still use a conservative clickable surface mark instead of inserting a chip into fragile DOM.
- Inline code is supported as normal selectable text.
- Closing a newly opened draft without sending removes the draft mark.
- Sending the first question promotes the draft mark into a persisted thread.
- Repeated questions on the same quote stay in the same local thread.
- Multiple quote threads can exist in the same conversation, including overlapping normal text marks.

## Floating Follow-up Panel

- The panel is draggable and stays as a floating overlay.
- Only one thread panel is shown at a time.
- The panel displays:
  - quote preview,
  - user questions,
  - assistant replies,
  - reply style control,
  - bottom follow-up input,
  - delete action.
- The native page composer is visually hidden while a panel is open, so the user naturally works through the panel.
- During a panel-sent response, a shared input blocker prevents accidental typing into the provider composer.
- The panel input is fixed-size, auto-wraps text, and scrolls after its maximum height.
- Assistant messages render sanitized HTML when the provider's page DOM exposes Markdown-derived HTML.
- Each assistant message has a small icon-only refresh button with the title `重新获取回复`.

## Sending And Capturing Replies

- The extension does not call OpenAI, Google, or any model API directly.
- Follow-up questions are sent through the provider's normal web composer.
- The generated prompt includes the selected quote and the user's question as context.
- Plugin-generated main-chat prompts and model replies are hidden from the main page while the quote thread exists.
- The latest active thread reply is kept hidden, not unloaded, while the panel is open so the refresh button can re-read it from the page DOM.
- When the panel is closed after a reply has been captured, hidden main-chat DOM can be unloaded to reduce page cost.
- If a reply is still pending, the latest hidden DOM is kept until capture completes.
- The manual refresh button re-extracts the corresponding assistant reply from the provider page DOM and updates the saved sidebar message when newer or fuller content is available.
- The refresh button does not resend the question.

## Provider-specific Behavior

### ChatGPT

- Supports `/c/*` and `/g/*` conversation routes.
- Handles thinking-model replies where a single visible assistant turn can contain multiple assistant message nodes separated by one or more thought buttons.
- Text before and after a thought button can be selected as long as the selection stays inside one Markdown segment.
- Cross-thought selection is intentionally not supported.
- Assistant capture ignores transient status labels such as `正在思考`, `Thinking`, `Reasoning`, and `ChatGPT 说:`.
- The plugin hides ChatGPT thought controls that belong to plugin-generated hidden turns.
- The page scroll lock targets ChatGPT's internal `group/scroll-root` container rather than `window`.

### Gemini

- Supports `https://gemini.google.com/app/*`.
- Uses Gemini-specific DOM selectors for turns, messages, composer, send button, and assistant extraction.
- Uses the shared pending input blocker and scroll lock.
- The page scroll lock targets Gemini's `infinite-scroller.chat-history` container.
- Includes Gemini-specific pending cleanup for the native stop button/input state.
- Manual reply refresh is available in the same panel UI as ChatGPT.

## Reply Style And Theme

The panel stores global reply style settings in local extension storage:

- `默认`
- `长一点`
- `短一点`
- `自定义`

`自定义` uses inline editing in the bottom action area. The saved custom instruction is inserted into future panel-generated prompts.

The extension also stores a global theme key. Current themes:

- green
- pink
- blue
- gold
- slate

The active theme drives quote marks, chips, panel focus states, popup controls, and the management page.

## Local Storage And Management Page

- Threads are stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Stored data is provider-aware and grouped by provider id plus conversation id.
- The management page reads structured storage data only; it does not scan ChatGPT or Gemini DOM.
- The management page supports:
  - viewing saved conversations,
  - viewing saved quote threads,
  - deleting a single thread,
  - deleting all saved threads for a conversation,
  - opening the original conversation URL.

Deleting a thread removes the corresponding local record and removes visible quote marks/chips from the current page when possible.

## Architecture

- `src/content.js` owns provider-neutral runtime state, route activation, quote thread lifecycle, prompt construction, persistence timing, pending-response capture, manual reply refresh, main-chat hiding, and scroll-lock orchestration.
- `src/provider.js` resolves the active provider from registered providers.
- `src/providers/chatgpt.js` registers ChatGPT provider metadata and exposes the ChatGPT DOM driver through the provider contract.
- `src/providers/chatgpt-dom.js` owns ChatGPT DOM queries, selection validation, segmented Markdown handling, quote anchoring, mark rendering/restoration, composer submission, assistant extraction, hidden main-turn handling, and ChatGPT scroll target lookup.
- `src/providers/gemini.js` registers Gemini provider metadata and exposes the Gemini DOM driver through the provider contract.
- `src/providers/gemini-dom.js` owns Gemini DOM queries, selection validation, quote anchoring, mark rendering/restoration, composer submission, assistant extraction, pending cleanup, and Gemini scroll target lookup.
- `src/sidebar.js` owns the floating panel, selection action UI, reply style controls, assistant refresh button UI, and panel interactions.
- `src/storage.js` owns persisted conversation/thread data and migration/reset policy.
- `src/sanitize.js` owns safe HTML rendering for saved assistant replies.
- `src/theme.js` and `src/theme.css` own shared theme definitions.
- `src/provider-input-blocker.js` owns the shared pending-response overlay for native composers.
- `src/scroll-lock.js` owns the provider-targeted scroll lock used during panel-sent responses.
- `popup.html` and `src/popup.js` own the extension action popup.
- `manager.html` and `src/manager.js` own the standalone management page.

Provider-specific DOM behavior should stay inside `src/providers/*-dom.js`. Shared business flow should stay provider-neutral in `src/content.js`.

## Known Boundaries

- The extension is designed for desktop Chrome/Edge Manifest V3.
- It does not sync data to the cloud.
- It does not call model APIs directly.
- Cross-thought selection in ChatGPT is intentionally not supported.
- Cross-message or cross-user/assistant selection is intentionally rejected.
- Formula marking is conservative to avoid corrupting provider-rendered DOM.
- ChatGPT code blocks and tables are referenced by a bar before the block rather than by inline text marks, so selecting exact code/table text is preserved in storage but the visible page marker is block-level.
- Already-unloaded hidden main-chat DOM cannot be manually refreshed until the provider page re-renders it, for example after a page refresh.
- If a saved quote cannot be matched safely after provider DOM changes, the extension keeps the saved thread but does not force-render an unsafe mark.
